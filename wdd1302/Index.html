    <p>
    My name's Dallin. I'm from Spokane Washington.
    I'm trying to become a software engineer and game developer.
    </p>
    <p>
    Game Development is a passion of mine because I like
    programming and music production and you use both in game
    development. Most of the classes I'm taking right now are
    all about backend development like making things functional
    and logically solving problems, so I see this chance to
    work on the front end as a big win.
    </p>
    <p>
    I’m great at solving
    puzzles, you usually can find me with a rubix cube in my
    hands at school. I’m learning Japanese. I hope to move to
    a foreign country one day. I think that would be an awesome 
    learning experience.
